# Group5-DSA_FinalProject
In this final project, We design and develop a terminal-based Bible app using appropriate data structures and algorithms. The application will allow users to search verses, bookmark passages, display a “verse of the day,” and maintain a search history — all within a simple command-line interface. This project reinforces the practical application of algorithmic logic and data structure design in a real-world context.
